# API

This has a very straightforward, intuitive core API. If you're new to this, you may also want to check out the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md), a simple walk-through tutorial on how to use this framework.

- [Primary API](./api/thallium.md)
- [Reflect API](./api/reflect.md)
- [Assertion API using `clean-assert`](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/clean-assert/blob/master/api.md), aliased as `thallium/assert`
- [Bundle API](./api/bundle.md)
- [Other APIs](./api/other.md)

I would also like to note that if you're importing this using ES6 module syntax (like with Babel or TypeScript), import `thallium` as a single default export.
