Usage: tl [options...] [--] [file globs...]

Options:

-h, --help
    Show a simpler help prompt.

-H, --help-detailed
    Show this help prompt.

--cwd [directory]
    Set the current working directory for Thallium to use. By default, it's
    inherited.

-c [file], --config [file]
    Use a custom config file. By default, this is inferred from the first file
    glob, for example `test/.tl.coffee` from a glob of
    `test/**/*.coffee`. If the extension does not match anything, this will
    first try to infer it from the glob before giving up.

    If this option is passed multiple times, the last one takes precedence.

-r [module], --require [module]
    Require a module before loading the config. This may default-export a
    thenable as well, to delay execution.

-r [ext:module], --require [ext:module]
    Register an extension with that module (so Thallium knows it's a register
    hook). Usually you don't even need to register the extension yourself, but
    if either the module or the language itself not listed in node-interpret,
    you'll need to specify an extension. If you're using Babel, you can use
    `.tl.babel.js` to the same effect.

    Note: the preceding dot in `ext` is optional. Both `ext` and `.ext` mean the
    same thing.

--
    Stop parsing options past this point. Treat any further argument as a file.

--color
    Force-enable terminal colors for core reporters, regardless of the
    applicable terminal/shell settings or support.

--no-color
    Force-disable terminal colors for core reporters, so that even if the
    terminal does support colors, only raw Unicode is printed.

All options are optional, and all unknown options are passed directly to Node.
If no file globs are given, `test/**/*.{extname of config found}` is used as the
default glob, with `test/.config.{extname}` being the default config, where the
`extname` is inferred.

This tries to be sane by attempting to infer the general intent and preferring
code over config in the CLI, so it's much easier to set up and run.
