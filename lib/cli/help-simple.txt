Usage: tl [options...] [--] [file globs...]

Options:

-h, --help
    Show this help prompt.

-H, --help-detailed
    Show a more detailed help prompt.

--cwd [directory]
    Set the current working directory for Thallium to use.

-c [file], --config [file]
    Use a custom config file.

-r [module], --require [module]
    `require` a given module before loading the config.

-r [ext:module], --require [ext:module]
    Register an extension with that module (so Thallium knows it's a register
    hook). Usually, you won't need to use this, but it's mainly for things like
    running Babel with a different set of plugins than what's specified in your
    `.babelrc`.

--opts [opts]
    Use a custom opts file instead of trying to find a `.tl.opts` somewhere.

--
    Stop parsing options.

--color
    Force-enable terminal colors for core reporters, regardless of the
    applicable terminal/shell settings or support.

--no-color
    Force-disable terminal colors for core reporters, so that even if the
    terminal does support colors, only raw Unicode is printed.

--env [key=value], -e [key=value]
    Set an environment variable, or omit `value` to unset it.

--respawn-as [file]
    Respawn using a different binary than the one used to execute the runner.
    Implies `--respawn` and causes `--no-respawn` to be ignored.

All unknown options are passed directly to Node. For more details on each
option, run the following command:
