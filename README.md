A simple, unopinionated, modular test framework meant to simplify your tests. It supports Node v0.10 and later, as well as browsers (tested in Chrome, Firefox, and PhantomJS 2).

*Note that this is a huge work in progress, and is probably not suited for production projects.*

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev thallium
```

## Usage and API

Check out the [documentation](http://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium/blob/master/docs/README.md).

```
tl
```

Couple specific notes:

1. You can use the framework without the built-in assertions. Use `thallium/core`, which has none of them preloaded, and implement your own assertions. Matter of fact, the built-in ones are actually themselves a plugin, `thallium/assertions`.

2. Any test properties you define in your tests are scoped per-test. These include assertions. Example:

    ```js
    t.test("test", t => {
        t.foo = 1
        t.hasOwn(t, "foo")

        t.test("inner", t => {
            t.hasOwn(t, "foo")
        })

        const tt = t.test("inner 2")

        tt.hasOwn(tt, "foo")
    })

    t.notHasOwn(t, "foo")
    ```

## Versioning

As soon as it's 1.0, I'll stick to [SemVer](https://semver.org). Until then, here's how I'll aim for new versions:

- Minor versions (`0.*`) represent larger breaking changes or larger new features. This includes much of the primary roadmap below.
- Patch versions (`0.1.*`, etc.) represent bug fixes and smaller breaking changes/new features. This includes some of the nice-to-haves I've listed below the roadmap.

I will try to avoid breaking changes on patch updates, but it's not guaranteed, particularly if it's because a bug fix.

## Recent Updates

See the [changelog](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the most recent published changes. It also contains some useful migration information for dealing with breaking changes.

## Roadmap

This list is in a very rough chronological order, with whatever's done struck through. If you want to complete any of these yourself, feel free to send me a PR! :smile:

Do note that it isn't necessarily comprehensive, although I try to keep it somewhat up to date.

**0.3:**

1. ~~Expose matching algorithm~~
2. ~~Separate assertions from test instance~~
3. ~~Allow for arguments to be bound for `t.try` (was `reflect.do`)~~
4. ~~Remove support for generators in `t.async` in favor of [`co`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/co), async functions, etc.~~
5. ~~Make most of the CLI/reporter constants configurable~~
6. ~~Remove `done` callback support for `t.async`, reporters, etc.~~
7. ~~Allow reporters to be removed~~
8. ~~Add default config~~
9. ~~Remove the `thallium` and `_thallium` aliases, and rename the repo's binaries accordingly~~~
    - ~~Only `tl` is actually documented~~
10. ~~Add more useful introspection methods (e.g. test name, test index, test's children, etc.)~~
11. ~~Add `t.call(plugin)`, where `plugin` accepts a `reflect` instance, and the result is returned untouched~~
    - ~~Deprecate `t.reflect()`, equivalent to `t.call(reflect => reflect)`~~
    - ~~Deprecate `t.use(...plugins)`, equivalent to the following:~~

    ```js
    t.call(reflect => {
        const t = reflect.methods
        plugins.forEach(plugin => { plugin.call(t, t) })
    })
    ```
12. ~~Create before/after lifecycle hooks~~
13. ~~Rename `t.async` &rarr; `t.test`, deprecate old form~~
14. ~~Support a `.tl.opts` file to prepend CLI arguments (and way to disable it)~~
15. ~~Add [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) support for Windows testing~~
16. ~~Add PhantomJS 2 to the Travis build~~
17. Drop support for Node pre-4
    - ES6 goodies now available in the CLI
    - ~~This doesn't happen until I get PhantomJS 2 running~~
18. ~~Move `reflect.loc` and `reflect.report` to their own module and deprecate them~~
19. ~~Complete migration utility~~
20. Update existing documentation

**0.3.1:**

1. Add `reflect.current()` to get current running test as a `Reflect` (not necessarily that of the backing instance)
    - This could potentially be difficult, but will be immensely useful for plugin authors
    - Deprecate first `t` argument in favor of this + function scoping

**0.3.x:** (after 0.3.0)

1. Add OS X to the Travis build
    - Travis has been having OSX issues lately, making debugging these errors a little harder.
2. Add diff support to all existing reporters
3. Document all the assertions
4. Support flaky tests via first-class retries
    - This is a requirement to self-host the runner

**0.4:**

1. Remove all the previously deprecated methods/etc.
2. Transition to TypeScript
    - I'm having enough of the highly uninformative `TypeError: foo has no method bar`, `TypeError: Cannot read property 'bar' of undefined`, and `TypeError: object #<Object> is not a function` (At least Node 6 gives the variable name...)
    - I get arrow functions and classes for free, without having to deal with Babel's monstrosity
3. Create DOM reporter
4. Add some promise-aware assertions

**0.4.x:** (after 0.4.0)

1. Trim off internal stack traces when sending errors to reporters
2. Add file watching support
3. Integrate with Istanbul
4. Add support for running tests in parallel

**0.5:**

1. Move `thallium/match` and `thallium/assert` out of core
2. Reimplement [`util-inspect`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/util-inspect) for browsers based on Node's current [`util.inspect`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inspect_object_options), since that is completely untested and completely unaware of ES6. :worried:
    - This will be published out of core
3. Create a nice REPL driver for Node, in addition to the CLI.\*
    - This will just be a module + sugar binary, so you can use it with any language

\* *That's something from Lisp-land I really wish was here...*

**Later:**

Here's the nice-to-haves, and so these are in no particular order:

- Write a few plugins/utilities for `describe`/`it` (likely trivial), etc
    - This will include more reporters as well

- Write lots of blog posts. :smile:
    - Why another testing framework
    - Why this uses code *for* configuration
    - Why this tries to infer so much (it's not as magical as it seems)
    - Why such a high focus on flexibility
    - etc.

- Write an alternative matching algorithm to be based off of the ES2015 Iterable (`Symbol.iterator`) protocol, etc.
    - This may likely also include the [proposed async iteration protocol](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration#async-iterators-and-async-iterables).

- Use the patience diff for larger data sets, since it deals with those a little more readably, a plus for data-heavy integration/end-to-end tests (this repo has some of those)
    - There doesn't appear to be a JS port yet, and algorithm documentation is scarce, so I'd have to write it myself, and it could be challenging.
