A simple, unopinionated, modular test framework meant to simplify your tests. It supports Node (from the [current LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/)), as well as PhantomJS 2 and browsers (tested in Chrome and Firefox).

*Note that this is a huge work in progress, and is probably not suited for production projects.*

## Installation

First, install [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

```sh
npm install --save-dev thallium

# If you would like it globally installed, that works, too.
npm install --global thallium
```

Also, if you target older runtimes like PhantomJS or Internet Explorer, this will require a Promise polyfill, such as [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise). That polyfill in particular is used by this library to test in PhantomJS 2.

## Usage and API

Check out the [documentation](http://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium/blob/master/docs/README.md).

```sh
# Your basic command
tl
```

Couple specific notes:

1. I plan to make this a very batteries-included framework. It includes several useful utilities like an assertion library far more helpful than Node's `assert` (you can easily define your own ad-hoc assertions, even - I do it in the tests themselves).

2. Not much configuration is required to get started. I aim for ease of use and convention over configuration, but I also try to enable as much flexibility as you need. Your config file can even return a promise, if that's what you need.

## Versioning

As soon as it's 1.0, I'll stick to [semver](https://semver.org). Until then, here's how I'll aim for new versions:

- Minor versions (`0.x`) represent larger breaking changes or larger new features. This includes much of the [primary roadmap](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium/blob/master/roadmap.md).
- Patch versions (`0.1.x`, `0.2.x`, etc.) represent bug fixes and smaller breaking changes/new features. This includes some of the nice-to-haves I've listed below the roadmap.

I will try to avoid breaking changes on patch updates, but it's not guaranteed, particularly if it's because a bug fix.

## Recent Updates

See the [changelog](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/thallium/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the most recent published changes. It also contains some useful migration information for dealing with breaking changes.
